Savvy DeCent Tech Can Outwit Old School Authoritaian Censorship
---------------------------------------------------------------

China’s foreign policy in the past month reminds me of babysitting my cousins over a decade ago. After spending time with them for the day, I received rave reviews. This comes with the territory of being characteristically easy-going. In fact, my most specific positive feedback came from my oldest cousin, who confirmed my competence by regaling how I had let him order both a soda _and_ a milkshake. Babysitters often skirt on discipline, whether as a means to endear trust or by simply being unaware of the more nuanced responsibilities of parenthood. I had no idea the extent to which I was spoiling my cousin, but the same can’t be said of the U.S. government and our allies across the European Union, who seem unable to adequately reprimand China’s repeated, brazen violations of international norms. China is as unrestrained as a lackadaisically monitored adolescent intoxicated by sugar, with no plans to slow down the junk food roll.

In just the most recent three weeks, we’ve seen China launch system-scale cyber attacks across multiple sectors of the Australian government, pandemic-ridden hospitals in the EU, and a coronavirus research lab in the UK. Anxiety almost piqued (although the threshold has been tested and expanded in 2020) after a border skirmish in Kashmir killed 20 Indian soldiers, and initiated the expulsion of Chinese mobile apps in India. Perhaps my favorite, and in a move that is almost admirably petty (and undoubtedly unethical,) the Chinese Consulate in Belfast [defied local laws](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/24/china-defies-court-order-over-building-of-wall-at-belfast-consulate "Guarding Article") to halt construction on a compound wall, and even took care to fly in their own laborers to complete the project!  

At last, the most tragic is the [National Security Legislation](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/30/world/asia/hong-kong-security-law-explain.html) that assuredly ended Hong Kong’s democratic independence. Hong Kong’s cityscape, multiculturalism, and world-class food scene (home to the best [chili sauce](https://foodwise.hk/en/Grocery/Condiments-&-Sauces/Chilli-Sauce/Yu-Kwen-Yick-Chili-Sauce/p/103514 "Chili Sauce"),) all culminate in its status as a global treasure. While the coronavirus remains a peripheral anxiety in Europe, and a grotesque failure in the United States, Beijing’s spree is practically unchecked. It feels as though Hong Kong is being barricaded behind more than just the infamous Chinese firewall, but instead a 21st century equivalent of the Iron Curtain. While this imperialist power grab lacks contemporary precedent, blockchain could grant an equally unprecedented opportunity to ensure press freedoms that the National Security Law concertedly eliminates. 

Ironically, Mainland Chinese citizens originally innovated this direct challenge to CCP’s largely impervious control of online information. In 2018, mass outrage exploded on online forums after a medical company produced and distributed 250,000 [non-compliant rabies vaccines](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/07/26/vaccine-scandal-gripping-china-could-cause-serious-problems-for-the-government/ "SCMP") Although denounced by Chinese leaders, articles and continued discourse on the topic was abruptly censored within the Chinese firewall. However, a determined netizen successfully embedded an investigative article on the matter in the metadata of an [Ethereum transaction](https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/24/17607690/chinese-internet-users-blockchain-share-censored-news-article-vaccines "Verve"), safely depositing the facts in an immutable ledger. 

While a potentially relevant cautionary tale about Chinese vaccine manufacturing, it also highlights blockchain’s most electrifying potential: restoring power to the individual independent of borders or institutions.

In Hong Kong, finding ways to usurp censorship is more critical than ever, as Western social media platforms, from Facebook to Zoom, recognize the expansion of China’s cyber control and have terminated data requests pending more detailed explanations of Beijing’s new  [National Security Law](https://in.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-protests-cyber-analysis/in-hong-kong-national-security-law-echoes-of-chinas-own-cyber-crackdown-idINKBN24819W "Rueters1"). As is the case in Mainland China, this will most likely conclude their operations in Hong Kong unless these companies conform to the CCP’s demands around user data flows. Even as both these companies have dubious moral stances on protecting user privacy, the NSL is so extensive in scope that even mildly incendiary critiques of the Chinese governing regime can be prosecuted. The sweeping transition the city will see within the next months inevitably embraces sophisticated surveillance infrastructure to decimate an equally sophisticated dissent network. This also includes foreign correspondents, to whom Hong Kong’s Chief Executive Carrie Lam extended a warm welcome if only they [comply with the legislation](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-hongkong-protests-idUKKBN24808B "Rueters2"). This isn’t exactly aligned with principles that dictate reporting should remain independent of state interference. In a modern world, we can’t allow Hong Kong’s voice to be silent, making decentralized social platforms tools imperative to not only preserving free speech there, but also to gaining an objective understanding of the CCP’s newly emboldened imperialist tactics. As individuals, decentralized technologies means we are no longer beholden to singular sources of information or Cold War fear mongering. Hong Kongers are no exception, and as allies we should advocate for and create platforms that uplift and empower their independent voice.

Not to mention, social media blockchain use cases also present unfettered potential to fighting disinformation and manipulation that currently threaten the longevity of democracy in the U.S.

        <p>One of my favorite memories of Hong Kong was when walking to a beloved outdoor coffee shop, and leisurely meandering through the Mid-Levels, a terraced neighborhood characterized by frequent and towering stair cases. In taking a random turn, I happened upon a quaint, but beautiful blue stuccoed mosque. Adjacent to a bustling sidewalk, it was still, tranquil, quiet. This experience distills the qualities that once made Hong Kong a multicultural oasis in its own right: the freedom to <i>be</i>, and the peace that brings even amidst the chaos of the metropolis.</p>

Beijing might come down from its sugar high, but I fear by the time governments and institutions step in, Hong Kong will be too far gone. However, if any collective can creatively and tenaciously resist, it _is_ the people of Hong Kong. I am saddened to say that coordinated efforts by free-market democracies to protect their freedom are not on the side of Hong Kongers, but decentralized technology can fill the gap.
