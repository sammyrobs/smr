Savvy DeCent Tech Can Outwit Old School Authoritaian Censorship
---------------------------------------------------------------

China’s foreign policy in the past month reminds me of babysitting my cousins over a decade ago. After spending time with them for the day, I received rave reviews. In addition to being fun, I’m characteristically easy-going. In fact, my most specific positive feedback came from my cousin Patrick, who confirmed my competence by regaling how I had let him order both a soda _and_ a milkshake. Babysitters often skirt on discipline, whether as a means to endear trust or more simply as care not reflected through the eyes of a parent. I had no idea the extent to which I was spoiling my cousin, but the same can’t be said of the U.S. government and our allies across the European Union. China is as unhinged as a laxidasically monitored adolescent intoxicated by sugar high, with no plans to slow down the junk food roll until Mom and Dad decidedly step in to restore order. 

In just the most recent two weeks alone, we’ve seen China launch system-scale cyber attacks across multiple sectors of the Australian government, pandemic-ridden hospitals in the EU, and coronavirus research lab in the UK. Anxiety almost piqued (the threshold has been tested and augmented in 2020) after a border skirmish in Kashmir killed 20 Indian soldiers, and initiated the banishment of Chinese mobile apps in India. Perhaps my favorite, and in a move that is almost admirably petty (and undoubtedly unethical,) the Chinese Consulate in Belfast [defied local laws](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/24/china-defies-court-order-over-building-of-wall-at-belfast-consulate "Guarding Article")to halt construction on a compound wall, and even took care to fly in their own laborers to complete the project!  

At last, the most tragic is the National Security Legislation that assuredly ended Hong Kong’s democratic independence. Hong Kong’s cityscape, multiculturalism, and world-class food scene (home to the best [chili sauce](https://foodwise.hk/en/Grocery/Condiments-&-Sauces/Chilli-Sauce/Yu-Kwen-Yick-Chili-Sauce/p/103514 "Chili Sauce"),) all culminate in its status as a global treasure. While the coronavirus remains a peripheral anxiety in Europe, and a grotesque failure in the United States, Western powers are largely powerless in standing up to Beijing. While this imperialist power grab lacks contemporary precedent, blockchain could grant an equally unprecedented opportunity to bypass press freedoms that the NSL concertedly eliminates. 

Ironically, Mainland Chinese citizens originally innovated this direct challenge to CCP’s largely impervious control of online information. In 2018, mass outrage exploded on online forums after a medical company produced and distributed 250,000 [non-compliant rabies vaccines](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/07/26/vaccine-scandal-gripping-china-could-cause-serious-problems-for-the-government/ "SCMP")Although denounced by Chinese leaders, articles and continued discourse on the topic was abruptly censored within the Chinese firewall. However, after a determined netizen successfully embedded an investigative article in the metadata of an [Ethereum transaction](https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/24/17607690/chinese-internet-users-blockchain-share-censored-news-article-vaccines "Verve"). 

While a potentially relevant cautionary tale about Chinese vaccine manufacturing, it also highlights blockchain’s most electrifying potential: restoring power to the individual independent of borders or institutions. Not to mention, facist and isolationist geopolitical trends could be squashed in the fall out of the pandemic, but utilizing blockchain as a weapon against censorship, disinformation, or manipulation on traditional social media platforms has unfettered potential in reviving the health of democracy world wide.

Moreover, finding ways to usurp censorship is more critical than ever, as Western social media platforms, from Facebook to Zoom, see this territorial invasion as an extension of China’s regional cyber control and have terminated data requests pending more detailed explanations of Beijing’s new [National Security Law](https://in.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-protests-cyber-analysis/in-hong-kong-national-security-law-echoes-of-chinas-own-cyber-crackdown-idINKBN24819W "Rueters1"). Even as both these companies have dubious moral stances on protecting user privacy, the NSL is so extensive in scope that even mildly incideniary critiques of the Chinese governing regime can be prosecuted.  In a way, it feels as though Hong Kong is being barricaded behind more than just the infamous Chinese firewall, but the 21st century equivalent of the iron curtain. The sweeping transition the city will see within the next months inevitably include sophisticated surveillance infrastructure to decimate an equally sophisticated dissent network. This includes foregin correspondents, to whom Hong Kong’s Chief Executive Carrie Lam extended a warm welcome if only they [comply with the legislation]](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-hongkong-protests-idUKKBN24808B "Rueters2"). This isn’t exactly aligned with principles that dictate reporting independent of state interference. In a modern world, we can’t allow Hong Kong’s voice to be silent, making decentralized social platforms tools imperative to a free press, but also an objective understanding of the CCP’s newly emboldened imperialist tactics. As individuals, decentralized technologies means we are no longer beholden to singular sources of information or Cold War fear mongering. Hong Kongers are no exception, and as allies we should advocate for and create platforms that uplift and empower their independent voice.

        <p>LOne of my favorite memories of Hong Kong was when walking to a beloved outdoor coffee shop, and leisurely meandering through the Mid-Levels, a terraced neighborhood characterized by frequent and towering stair cases. In taking a random turn, I happened upon a quaint, but beautiful blue stuccoed mosque. Adjacent to a bustling sidewalk, it was still, tranquil, quiet. This experience distills the qualities that once made Hong Kong an multicultural oasis in its own right: the freedom to be, do, and speak.</p>

Beijing might come down from its sugar high, but I fear by the time governments and institutions return home, Hong Kong will be too far gone. However, any collective can creatively and tenaciously resist, it is with the people of Hong Kong. I am saddened to say that coordinated efforts by free-market democracies to protect their freedom might not be on the side of Hong Kongers, but decentralized technology can fill the gap.
