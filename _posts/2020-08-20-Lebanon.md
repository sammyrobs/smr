All Eyes on Lebanon: Government Accountability + Blockchain
-----------------------------------------------------------

<p><align="center"><img width="460" height="480" src="https://sammyrobs.github.io/smr/assets/images/Rainbow.png"></p>

When I first visited Lebanon in 2019, a terrible storm canceled my initial departure, giving me a serendipitous excuse to extend my trip. An airline attendant helped me rebook my ticket and escorted me to a special exit. I didn’t think anything of it, I was just thinking about kunefe.

As I returned to the airport for the last time, it hit me — I had never formally reentered the country via airport immigration. An acute heat wave crashed over my body, anxiety simmering within my bloodstream: had I continued my jubilant victory lap without a proper visa? As the hybrid military-immigration officer halfheartedly probed my passport, I realized he wasn’t looking for a stamp, but rather a photo. “Wow, 1991… you’re so young.”

After a light flirtation, which I reciprocated given the amorphous nature of my fate, the officer wasn’t going to arrest me for an entry-exit violation, instead he was propositioning me to stay even longer in Lebanon, meaning forever. With a stroke of luck and the steadfast constancy of the male gaze, I walked away without a stamp, but secured a marriage proposal.

The unfaltering predictability of male behavior and corruption weave a recurring theme in Lebanon’s storied history of government maleficence. In 2019, news surfaced that the former Prime Minister Saad Hariri sent [over $16 million](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/30/world/middleeast/lebanon-hariri-model.html) to a South African supermodel over the course of their relationship. While [deeply proud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsm4poTWjMs) of our South African sister, 
the news broke as the country tripped off a fiscal cliff into economic free fall. As the world’s [third most indebted nation](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-50183895), country-wide antigovernment protests erupted and endured until the onset of COVID-19, inspiring this protest [bop](https://soundcloud.com/dj-rk/gebran-bassil) sanctioning unsavory directives towards the Foreign Minister’s mother.

<img width="460" height="480" src="https://sammyrobs.github.io/smr/assets/images/beauty.png" align="left"/> Lebanon’s unique demography and harrowing history have created an overtly polarized, and hence, defective sectarian governing body. Within the government, each sect correspondingly represents Lebanon’s Christian, Sunni, and Shia populations, who compete for lucrative government contracts. Each sect sees public utility service provisions as a means for building personal wealth, creating constant deadlock in decision making and [service delivery](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20180328-lebanon-is-drowning-in-its-own-waste). 
The consequences of this rampant corruption came to a head two weeks ago when [2,750 tons of highly-explosive ammonium nitrate](https://apnews.com/7a104960789d9b25e89a889fbbc125e7) idly stored on Beirut’s port exploded, [killing at least 160 people](https://apnews.com/598da05d3907aa58399c86ff85a9babc) and obliterating large swaths of the city. Civilians and the privately funded Lebanese Red Cross, the only emergency services in the country, are left to pick up the pieces with no government leadership in sight. If you can, please donate [here.](https://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/lebanon-relief?utm_term=re7R78DA2&fbclid=IwAR3a9Tpuo5yDrgsqnlR9HI7dg8sZO7SrlR9R5V6bc97BYG2MK1m6If73LnE)

Alongside Lebanon’s fractious political system, a majority of the population is struggling to secure basic provisions as prices of everything from flour to salt have nearly [quadrupled.](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/lebanon-economic-crisis-food-shortage-price-hike) Even now, approximately one quarter of the Lebanese population is refugees, who have flown steadily into the country from 1969 to the present day Civil War in Syria. Regardless of the lens through which one inspects Lebanon’s fragile existence, any minor disturbance is substantially destabilizing.

Last week, Lebanon’s entire cabinet resigned. Many have called for different visions of Lebanon’s future, including an [imperialist revival.](https://elombah.com/lebanon-over-55000-lebanese-sign-petition-ask-france-to-recolonise-them/) Perhaps the government could benefit from holistic reform of men’s most ancient vices. Both require involved disengagement from the patriarchy, which is why Lebanon’s most promising reform is the implementation of blockchain-enabled government spending ledgers, permitting complete oversight from citizens, third party organizations, and international stakeholders.

Implementing blockchain tech in government spending remains a frontier use case. Cryptocurrency has been used to reach [sanctioned or closed economies](https://www.openmoneyinitiative.org/) across several platforms. Non-profits, most notably [UNICEF](https://www.unicef.org/innovation/blockchain), have pivoted to blockchain investment in developing economies as well as with charitable transactions, like [GiveTrack.](https://www.givetrack.org/)

<img width="460" height="480" src="https://sammyrobs.github.io/smr/assets/images/Lemon.png" align="right"/> In Lebanon specifically, increased transparency and government oversight would mend the distrust of a disillusioned civil society. It would also as assuage concerns of multinational organizations and foreign governments hesitant to bail the country out of its deeply embedded economic and political controversies. Just months before the devastating blast, the Lebanese government was refused an [IMF loan](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lebanon-crisis-imf-analysis-idUSKBN22U1YE) after failing to reach consensus on how to remedy pervasive sectarian corruption. In enabling a blockchain based spending ledgers, auditing can be built into the chain’s governance structure. As transactions are made, validators can monitor the transaction’s adherence to planned government spending and henceforth create new blocks. Moreover, blockchain transactions are immutable — facilitating unprecedented transparency and allowing distributed access to the transaction data by looking up a block number, transaction hash, or private key affiliated with a government agency. Uninterrupted access to transaction history empowers Lebanese citizens, who have already electrified the world with their impassioned and sustained solidarity, to spend less time in the streets, and more time enjoying and advancing their beautiful country.

The long-term impacts of this blockchain use case are, like Lebanon’s current overlapping crisis, multi-faceted and complex; only now we are primed to see overtly positive outcomes. As political risk declines, foreign investment and tourism dramatically increase. Lebanon’s massive civil service ([approximately 1 in 10 Lebanese](https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/why-lebanons-people-are-turning-on-their-politicians) collect government salaries) can mobilize with technical education to invent and implement other civic blockchain use cases, such as creating processes to [protect and provide services](https://www.parity.io/un-world-food-programme-uses-parity-ethereum-to-aid-100-000-refugees/) for Lebanon’s refugee population.

The application of such tech can hold governments accountable across the world, especially the United States. With the passage of the $3.1 trillion COVID-19 relief CARES Act, the U.S. federal government allocated $659 billion dollars for its Paycheck Protection Plan (PPP.) The PPP incentivized small businesses to keep employees on payroll by taking out low-interest federal loans even as the virus had impeded or even halted operations. However, in the months following the bill’s passing, we’ve seen that organizations with strong bank connections were given privileged access to loans. Well-resourced organizations, from the [Los Angeles Lakers](https://www.latimes.com/sports/lakers/story/2020-04-27/lakers-pay-back-small-business-coronavirus-ppp-relief-funds) to more than [1,300 private equity backed ventures,](https://www.thedailybeast.com/private-equity-backed-firms-got-ppp-funds-for-businesses-hit-by-coronavirus) took advantage of this plan, while small businesses, comprising [44% of the U.S. economy,](https://advocacy.sba.gov/2019/01/30/small-businesses-generate-44-percent-of-u-s-economic-activity/) were left in the cold. Some of these enterprises, including the L.A. Lakers and several large chain restaurants, returned the funds after public outcry, but the policy was so inadequately implemented and monitored that even the [Ayn Rand Institute](https://projects.propublica.org/coronavirus/bailouts/loans/the-ayn-rand-institute-the-center-for-the-advancement-of-objectivism-f5ec89c81bc0bec96f4224999627fc8c) received anywhere from $350,000-$1M in PPP funds. Poor, Ayn… she’s turning over in her grave right now.

Relevant exploration of irony abound, the Treasury only provided data in range form. The opaque distribution of funding is really only the beginning — as public lending data has only been disclosed for a meager [650,000](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ppp-loan-recipients-treasury-names-small-businesses-receiving-funds/) out of [4.5 million small businesses](https://www.salon.com/2020/06/12/jaw-dropping-corruption-mnuchin-refuses-to-disclose-which-businesses-got-taxpayer-backed-bailouts/) who received PPP funds. In a Senate testimony last month, Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin [maintained the position](https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/treasury-chief-refusing-disclose-recipients-virus-aid-71227238) that “that’s proprietary information, and in many cases, for sole proprietors and small businesses, it is confidential information.” Without transparency, the only logical explanation is barbarous misconduct, and the only answer is technological interventions that maintain transparency and, subsequently, governance by the will of the people.

Blockchain presents opportunities for transparency at the hands of those who govern, but also the governed. In crafting policy, many U.S. lawmakers are reluctant to expand public welfare programs across a litany of excuses, but one most prominently falls along the lines of “we don’t want to spend hard-earned tax payer money on someone who is (insert rhetoric demonizing poverty here).” This follows an argument that unscrupulous individuals will seek out welfare benefits as a small-scale measure within an elaborate grifting scheme.

Since paranoia often stems from personal experience (re: PPP), I’m happy to report that blockchain-enabled government aid dispersal offers reciprocal transparency. Governments can create unique wallets tied to tax IDs and use them to disperse SNAP benefits, housing assistance, or unemployment benefits. In doing so, the money can be spent from a single source place, curtailing “waste,” although [they would know all about that.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2020/06/25/irs-stimulus-checks-dead-people-gao/) Moreover, government agencies have immediate access to data on the efficacy of welfare programs and how the program outcomes align with a project’s original objectives. This is crucial for any organizations that work with public funds. Not to mention, external economic and environmental influences, like sudden drop in GDP due to natural disasters or a global health crisis, could immediately trigger additional government aid disbursement with the implementation of smart contracts. Regardless of the application, blockchain’s most practical advantages are efficiency, transparency, and security. All three are essential habits of high-functioning democratic governments.

<img width="460" height="480" src="https://sammyrobs.github.io/smr/assets/images/Falafel.png" align="left"/> While in Beirut early 2019, I visited the treasured [Sursock Museum,](https://sursock.museum/) a contemporary art museum housed in the residence of the eponymic Beirut aristocrat who donated the villa to the city. Enduring for more than a century despite Lebanon’s consistent oscillation between peace and conflict, the museum was [unfortunately devastated](https://www.theartnewspaper.com/news/beirut-explosion) by the blast. I didn’t know this until I reached out to the museum for the purpose of writing this article.

In the aftermath of the explosion, I reflected on an exhibit I saw at the Sursock, where artists submitted works across various media depicting “Beirut’s 7th Renaissance.” The goal of the exhibit was to interpret Beirut’s invincibility across centuries of misfortune, catastrophe, and loss. It was exquisitely unapologetic, just like the city itself. The vibe in Beirut embodies this unique brand of swagger, engendered by withstanding challenges that are seemingly insurmountable.

n a way, the irony, that I’ve mentioned so frequently in this essay, is ever present in this anecdote. The exhibit was a vehicle with which I planned to draw parallels alongside Lebanon’s timeless persistence, signaling that joy and comfort are reliably ephemeral and that beyond this tragedy Beirut will once again persevere. With blockchain, Beirut, can rebuild without anticipating yet another rebirth after policies for peace and individual prosperity fail once more. Employing blockchain technology to hold lawmakers responsible to the people is an imperative for the national security of Lebanon and nations around the world.

I’m always drawn to cities with complicated pasts. I love the air of resilience and a capacity to reinvent. Invention drives prosperity, and it is our duty as a global community to invent systems that safeguard the dignity of those who need us most. In doing so, we are collectively inventing the upward trajectory of our global society, where from Beirut to Berlin, D.C. to Dakar, we’re using blockchain to restore power to the people.
