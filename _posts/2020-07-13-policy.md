_Originally published May 2020_ 

About a year ago, I panicked. The reason: Finding a birthday gift for my boss. The confounding variable: He is a billionaire. For the one percent of the one percent of global wealth, gifts are ubiquitous and limitless, making even the most auspicious surprise indistinguishable from an otherwise hackneyed ritual.

Amidst the coronavirus pandemic, none of the world’s most privileged are wishing they had realized the value of a gift more than Donald Trump. In a ripe, perhaps perfect opportunity to reassert American leadership against a derelict CCP (who consciously allowed COVID-19 to spread across the globe), Trump utterly failed to rise to the occasion.
   
Even as the pandemic is ever raging across the planet, nations are collectively contemplating dramatic geopolitical shifts in China’s role in the global arena. In its COVID-19 relief response legislation, the Japanese government earmarked [more than $2 billion dollars](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2020/04/09/japan-ditches-china-in-multi-billion-dollar-coronavirus-shakeout/#351100175341) to relocate Japanese manufacturing from mainland China. As Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have bombastically and [sometimes mendaciously](https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/05/opinions/trumps-anti-china-theory-implodes-sachs/index.html) asserted, U.S.-Sino relations are treading perilous waters. 

Our collective prosperity undoubtedly requires amicable relations with China, and the world has an important opportunity to contain a state only feigning multilateralism for its own benefit. The U.S. in particular must leverage our advantages as a free market democracy. We can start by passing progressive legislation that remedies prevailing issues in our national consciousness that contradict a steadfast global human rights agenda. This is how we finally outplay the Chinese strategic rivalry. If we do not, our rivals will continue to exploit the pervasive issues in American society at the intersection of our political, economic, and healthcare systems, especially as exacerbated by the pandemic. 

**Racial Justice & Policing**

The foreign press corps in Beijing receives a special policy brief from the Chinese government every year. This annual publication meticulously chronicles what the CCP views as ghastly human rights abuses at the hands of the U.S. government. Although the most recent administration has [expanded this survey](https://theintercept.com/2020/02/25/family-separations-border-torture-report/), the prevailing theme featured in these briefs is police brutality.  Seizing on this vast fault line in U.S. society is not an original idea of this decade. It dates back to the earliest days of the CCP and Maoist philosophy. Ruodin Duan, a Ph.D. candidate in Harvard’s history department, explains that [Mao equated racial struggle with class struggle](https://medium.com/fairbank-center/black-power-in-china-maos-support-for-african-american-racial-struggle-as-class-struggle-7673f2a6abb), and believed China could leverage racial divisions in the U.S. to sow the seeds of socialism aboard.

Outside China, it is widely proven that the Russian government also [exploited our racial divides](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/17/us/politics/russia-2016-influence-campaign.html) to influence voters during the 2016 presidential election. Widespread distrust of law enforcement and a dearth of accountability for racial bias in policing tactics has caused heartrending devastation in communities across the U.S. It dually gives foreign adversaries an open opportunity to exploit our social vulnerabilities explicitly linked to clashes between police officers and civilians.

While avoiding painful byproducts of racism in our society and how it manifests in largely unregulated police authority, the world spins on and our rivals take note. We therefore remain wholly exposed to turpitude. Our legislators remain unable to authentically promote consistent human rights policies, compromising our national security and global leadership. 

**The College Industrial Complex**

Broad socio-economic divides in the U.S. underpin extensive discord in our country, most notably between the ["coastal elites"](https://www.salon.com/2016/11/20/real-americans-vs-coastal-elites-what-right-wing-sneers-at-city-dwellers-really-mean/)
and and residents of non-coastal regions who feel left behind by our government and economy. This deep-seated distrust of institutions rationally stems from the pervasive inequities in our education system. College degrees enable upward social mobility, but societal requisites to obtain one intensify inequality as college has become unfathomably expensive. The cost of attending a university has increased more than any other good or service in the U.S.—[by more than 1000% since 1978.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-08-15/cost-of-college-degree-in-u-s-soars-12-fold-chart-of-the-day) The value of government aid has diminished accordingly. In 1975, a Federally dispersed
[Pell Grant](https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/grants/pell/) covered 116% of in-state tuition; now [it contributes a meanger 42%](https://www.latimes.com/local/abcarian/la-me-ra-ivory-tower-movie-20140613-column.html). Skyrocketing tuition rates support sprawling university bureaucracies designed to provide resources to students, as opposed to directly increasing the quality of academic instruction. Now, universities essentially operate like commercial institutions, increasing services alongside costs born directly by their customers—the students.

This directly relates to foreign policy, as wealthy international students often matriculate after paying full tuition. Particularly after the financial crash of 2008, the U.S. saw a [massive influx of international students](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/11/20/new-us-foreign-student-enrollment-doubled-since-great-recession/) as an antidote to bleeding revenues and falling enrollment rates. Since then, approximately ⅓ of international students [hail from mainland China.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/12/17/chinas-education-system-produces-stellar-test-scores-so-why-do-students-head-abroad-each-year-study/) Even [Xi Jinping's own daughter](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-did-chinas-first-daughter-find-in-america) was educated at Harvard. This is not to say that we should prevent Chinese students from attending U.S. universities, as some of the [radically conservative members](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexandrasternlicht/2020/04/26/senator-tom-cotton-ramps-up-anti-china-rhetoric-says-chinese-students-should-be-banned-from-us/#4cae88ce99a2) of our government advocate. On the contrary, we should continue to facilitate widespread cultural and educational exchange to promote positive interactions with Chinese citizens. Through these interactions, the inherent advantages of a society committed to values of free speech become inevitable exports, bolstering our capacity to lead in emerging international struggles for ideological supremacy and leadership.

However, alongside this continued exchange, we must eliminate barriers to entry that forsake Americans and tether graduates to student debt. The most logical intervention is [student loan forgiveness](https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/student-loan-debt-day-one), but our government could support alternative higher-learning opportunities like trade schools, ranging from civil service programs to high-tech training investment. In turn, our workforce and citizenry will be collectively empowered, safeguarding individual livelihoods and our democracy. 

**Foreign Influence Laws** 

Overhauling corrupt channels where our legislators and leaders enjoy unfettered personal benefit by trading favors with external influence, whether corporations or foreign governments, is essential to restoring our status as a leading democratic voice. This should start with a bipartisan investigation of Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao’s connections to the highest echelons of the Chinese government.

[New York Times'](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/02/us/politics/elaine-chao-china.html) reporters documented considerable proposed budget cuts to the U.S. maritime industry by the transportation department under Ms. Chao. Meanwhile, her family’s global transport company has redoubled commitments to Chinese shipbuilders. The connection is speculative, but raises concerns as Ms. Chao, although not directly compensated by her family’s business, serves on boards of several Chinese companies and banks. Chao deems this “unremarkable,” but any foreigner with business experience in China will gawk at such privileged access in a culture that is inherently wary of external commercial interactions.  This is particularly alarming because the line between private business and state-owned enterprises has been blurred to the extent that the CCP controls revenue and growth of all private companies. Consequently, Chao’s involvement in China’s private sector implies direct and favorable connections to Chinese government. 

Not to mention, Ms. Chao’s husband is Senator Mitch McConnell, the most powerful member of the federal legislature. He has received substantial campaign contributions from his father-in-law’s business. McConnell was also the fiercest proponent of [_Citzens United_](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/citizens-united-explained), which enables opaque flows of corporate and foreign capital into our political system.  While one cannot conclude whether Chao or McConnell are influenced by the former’s extensive ties to the CCP, it is imperative to the health of democracy that we demand rigorous congressional oversight into these connections and how they impact our national security.

My boss was Chinese. While living in China, I experienced poignantly in my personal and professional relationships the explicit contrasts in our countries’ distinct value systems. Despite the incredible challenges we face in forging productive, friendly U.S.-China relations moving forward, I remain confident that the advantages of a free market and open society will ultimately prevail to define world order. In meeting our obligation to cultivate and protect democracies around the world, however, we must start by cleaning our own house.

This virus has wrought devastation across the world, and continues to do so in the U.S. with no centralized directive in sight. Although we can never overstate the grief and loss our country is experiencing, what is left in the rubble is a tiny light. I don’t know if I can call it a gift—rather, a path. A path to progressive leadership both in the U.S. and abroad.
