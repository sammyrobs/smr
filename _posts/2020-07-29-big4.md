Where Big Tech's Anti-trust Hearings and China Meet: Demand for Web 3.0 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

There is a litany of reasons to wake up circa 3 AM, in a cold sweat, seething with anxiety. For me, I suffer from night terrors about... deeply insecure men. 
This isn't a tirade about my exes--its a valid assessment of, and deeply rooted fear about the world's most powerful men. With the ever mounting tensions between 
the U.S. and China, I can't help but imagine both country's leaders are riding a seesaw in the middle of a violent storm; where as one rises alongside 
the misstep of the other, he quickly plummets following an episode of self-defeating overreach. Perhaps this back and forth is the new [ping-pong diplomacy](https://www.history.com/news/ping-pong-diplomacy) 
(inspiring, of course, the opposite outcome.) Over the past week, I must concede that China put another point on the board as the Chinese government 
[expanded its Blockchain-based Service Network (BSN)](https://www.coindesk.com/chinas-blockchain-infrastructure-to-extend-global-reach-with-six-public-chains) by partnering with six public chains.   

China officially broadcasted these audacious plans to expand blockchain development late last year. 
The announcement coincides with the [Made in China 2025 Policy,](https://thediplomat.com/2019/02/made-in-china-2025-explained/) an initiative detailing China’s plan to become the world’s most 
technologically sophisticated society, and subsequently the epicenter of technological exports.

Throughout the world, the implications of expanded global Chinese leadership have intensified varying degrees of disquiet due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The primary source of anxiety for most is the CCP’s unabashed desire for unquestioned, centralized control. In China’s most recent initiative for the sweeping development and implementation of blockchain tech, it is natural for onlookers to experience momentary whiplash, as investing in web infrastructure that is intrinsically _de_centralized seems antithetical to the sustained existence of the CCP. Additionally, as with any entity with insatiable desire for inexhaustible flows of transnational data, this initiative demands a valid measure of hesitation about the decentralized purity of the future of Chinese blockchain products, 
[as is already the case.](https://www.coindesk.com/everyones-worst-fears-about-eos-are-proving-true) This is the stark reality of data platforms and authoritarian control. 

As we’ve seen with safety concerns related to the Chinese social platform TikTok, the U.S. government is weighing national security and user privacy through the lens of a strategic rivalry. It does, however, reveal a double standard in their approach to America’s homegrown tech monoliths, who embody their own distinct threat to privacy and democracy. As Facebook, Amazon, Apple, and Alphabet Inc (referred to as Google throughout this article), dial in to Zoom and testify before Congress this week, I can’t help but draw parallels between the CCP’s expansionist threat to global security and the unchecked dominance of these four companies. Addressing the unprecedented policy challenges to regulating anticompetitive predation in the emergence of multinational tech platforms presents unique, layered complexity. I believe that assessing these platforms must mirror the approach towards nefarious authoritarian actors. The most logical, and geopolitically strategic outcome will combine legislation and a broader transition to mass adoption of decentralized technology, 
which the Chinese government already regards as [“a core technological breakthrough."](http://www.xinhuanet.com/2019-10/25/c_1125153665.htm)


## Where Antitrust Legislation has Failed 
 
As many elements of technology are intrinsically borderless and intangible, the impulses of authoritarian expansionism are practically irresistible. In a detailed account of how antitrust regulation failed to detect and contain Amazon’s monopolistic growth, [Lina Khan of the Yale Law Journal](https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox) describes how antitrust rationale “assumes that predation is irrational precisely because firms prioritize profits over growth,” which disregards the very heart of Silicon Valley’s priorities and capital markets. The doctrine of “fail fast” lends itself to the immediate implementation of new algorithms and acquisitions where the singular metric is profitability. The rise of tech oligopolies is also partially natural, as these four companies were among the earliest adopters in the respective niche, allowing a head start on amassing tech’s most valuable currency: user data. Khan outlines this as “huge first-mover advantages stemming from data collection and network effects,” which elevate barriers to entry for competitors

These four companies' dominance was not built on data alone, but also on creating the technical infrastructure that underpins our interactions with the web, and that competitors _rely_ on to enter the market. Khan admits that these forces precluded “dominance by a small number of firms.” Moreover, as regulators adhered to traditional metrics for anticompetitive tactics, they failed to recognize the monopolizing effect mergers had when assessing material valuation alone, determining “the monetary value of a deal may not be a good proxy for the scope and scale of data at stake.” In tech platform markets, control over data yields dominance in a way that money alone doesn't represent, especially because many services are freely accessible on these platforms. From this perspective, both efficiency and consumer welfare are optimized, and monopolistic tendencies remain intact. Khan asserts that such a reductive standard of consumer welfare “betrays legislative history,” where the initial goal of antitrust legislation was to facilitate “a host of political economic ends—including our interests as workers, producers, entrepreneurs, and citizens.” 

<img width="460" height="480" src="https://sammyrobs.github.io/smr/assets/images/curious.jpg" align="left"/> 

Employing this protracted lens of consumer welfare, the political case for dismantling the Big Four’s authoritarian power is irrefutable. The Big Four powers have individually contested that their interests as a corporate entity are mutually exclusive of politics. Phillip Rogaway [argues](https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/papers/moral-fn.pdf) that “technological ideas and technological things are not politically neutral: routinely, they have strong, built-in tendencies,”using the creation and deployment of nuclear weapons as a primary example. He contends that in some cases, it is impossible to forecast how the application of technology might have a malicious impact, but cites that many decision making processes lack a multi-stakeholder consideration of ethical consequences. 

This is largely due to another critical aspect of Silicon Valley’s distinct milieu: the indoctrination of [technological optimism.](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/techno-optimism-dangerous_b_7746682?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9kdWNrZHVja2dvLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAABUi-i1tIsgnE7oyiFTFGspqp5jxK0hWUY3gOsOgVBt20hxZDPL9ryxcP9bag0HW_b2h4v9wI4bGU4B9KjkxAkac1B0RxnMQ1p4KBVe1ESbsyGowRWuWf7B11QTXPCSyUbOIzm39-C4TMqjrLlp7mx-g2D1CVDvm6AHO1lks-kDE)This idea asserts that while “technology does bring some unintended consequences, innovation itself will see us through.” Rogaway forewarns “unbridled technological optimism undermines the basic need for social responsibility." Each of the Big Four founders exercised the technological optimism defense to offer good will to users, and even legislators. However, their repeated offenses not only signal market oligopolies, but how their economic power is intertwined with political dominance founded on bountiful reserves of user data. This returns to a core tenant of antitrust regulation at the turn of the 20th century, which 
“was the understanding that [concentration of economic power](https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox)also consolidates political power, “breed[ing] antidemocratic political pressures.” In the case of the Big Four, antidemocratic impulses have created a capitalist surveillance state, demonstrating how centralized data control yields authoritarian tendencies.

## Control of Information 

The central issue with unregulated data silos in the hands of power hungry tech oligarchies isn’t simply the capture of the data itself, but that the “the basic contours of the surveillance state are [fundamentally unknowable](https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/papers/moral-fn.pdf)."Adhering to impenetrable internal protocols, these companies dictate how users interact with their products, leaving little to no bargaining power for the users they serve. The opaque control of information is even more threatening as these platforms are the most powerful cultural curators in our society. The control of information is not just a product of social platforms, but also related to Amazon. In its aggressive vertical integration of all services related to e-commerce, Amazon has also stepped into the publishing game. Amazon is now positioned to charge external publishers more for selling books on its platform. This [has forced publishers](https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox)
who previously used bestseller titles to subsidize the publishing of “unusual, quirky, offbeat, or politically risky ideas, as well as books from new and unproven authors'' to “both publishing fewer titles and focusing largely on books by celebrities." This unprecedented control over media consumption reinforces both a core tenant of antitrust framework, which necessitates regulation when entities “undermine media diversity,” as well as the understood nature of authoritarian realities, where the flow of information and ideas is monitored.

On the other hand, the marketplace of ideas is dually imperiled by the influx of disinformation. This is a widely acknowledged attribute of the Big Four’s most incorrigible member, Facebook. In serial breeches of user data, Facebook has vowed time and time again to alter their algorithms to safeguard against data hacking, but more pointedly to protect unwitting victims from manipulation. The most relevant today, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, 
is [scientific disinformation.](https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/506475-house-democrats-press-twitter-facebook-google-for-reports-on-coronavirus)In her book [_How to Lose a Country_](https://bookshop.org/books/how-to-lose-a-country-the-7-steps-from-democracy-to-dictatorship/9780008340612), Ece Temelkuran explains how disinformation is “amplified through social media, multiplying the fairy tales more than ever and allowing the ignorant to claim equality with the informed.” On social platforms, the user interface is neutral across the spectrum of expertise, limiting user detection of false information. Advocates of these platforms will also attest that distinguishing malevolent actors from commonplace users isn’t a self-correcting capability built into the platform. I agree, and I don’t see this as an engineering problem with a corresponding engineering solution. Instead, it is a singular commitment on the part of the Big Four to secure and sustain power through any means necessary, including the support of increased engagement with false information. 

Progressive journalism was also essential to the success of antitrust legislation. [_The Jungle_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jungle)by Upton Sinclair is a revered text in American history because it painted a demoralizing, gruesome image of the meat packing industry. Ida Tarbell’s damning investigation 
[_The History of the Standard Oil Company_](https://archive.org/details/historyofstandar00tarbuoft), alongside Sinclair galvanized public opinion on industrial maleficence. This journalistic epoch was directed by
["the Muckrakers"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muckraker)who founded an investigative tradition exposing and demonizing corporate malpractice. The media was instrumental to garnering public policy support for antitrust regulations. However, just as speaking out against authoritarian regimes is sometimes life-threatening, the moderating role of the Big Four in the media we consume not only threatens a broad public understanding of their monopoly, but the longevity of our democracy. 

## Intimidation 

The perpetuation of controlled information empowers a culture of intimidation and fear that doesn’t simply imply economic harm, it is becoming a global authoritarian force. After the Philippines elected Rodrigo Dutere in 2016, the country’s most prominent investigative journalist Maria Ressa raised concerns that the newly elected leader was [exploiting Facebook.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-12-07/how-rodrigo-duterte-turned-facebook-into-a-weapon-with-a-little-help-from-facebook)
Dutere flooded the platform with thousands of fake accounts to raise his profile and oust political rivals. Ressa brought these concerns to [Facebook, who declared](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-12-07/how-rodrigo-duterte-turned-facebook-into-a-weapon-with-a-little-help-from-facebook) “an aspect of the problem in the Philippines is simply that the country has come online fast and hasn’t yet learned the emergent rules of the internet.”
Both derelict and simplistic, the issue is not digital literacy for new internet users, it's the unprecedented power with which Facebook facilitates interference in political outcomes. Temelkuran contends that even seasoned veterans of internet discourse face a lawless landscape, noting “the digital sphere, which now informs the real-life political sphere, is still lacking in laws and law enforcement.” Having already faced an onslaught of harassment, Ressa admitted to being deep fearful that speaking out against Facebook would affect her professional trajectory. Her popular news site, Rappler, predominantly operates on Facebook. She outlined intense anxieties about being targeted, musing “what if Facebook tweaked the algorithm for the Rappler page, causing traffic to plummet? What if it selectively removed monetization features critical to the site’s success?”

Similarly, the heart of antitrust probes into Google’s uncontested monopoly in the ad-tech space demonstrated evidenced fear of reproach. Google’s technology underpins almost all of digital advertising infrastructure, making it “the gatekeeper to about [90% of advertising space](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-23/murdoch-could-soon-reap-reward-in-his-long-war-against-google) that websites sell using automated systems.”
In the World Wide Web Consortium, where dominant market players gather to discuss web governance, a lawyer for a number of startups in the [Web Advertising Business Group (WABG)](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-16/google-s-cookie-overhaul-could-reshape-the-digital-ad-industry) noted “the success or failure of many in the WABG are already contingent upon maintaining a good relationship with Google. As such, there is likely to be some perceived risk to being openly critical of the dominant market player in a public forum.” Khan details that after Quidsi, an Amazon competitor, rejected an offer for acquisition in 2008, Amazon engaged in an aggressive price war where Quidsi couldn’t compete. In the end, market exit was the only viable alternative, and “although Walmart offered a higher final bid, ‘the Quidsi executives stuck with Amazon, largely out of fear." 

## Odious Alliances 

The Big Four’s unbridled authoritarian power fuels their capacity for independent diplomatic engagement, even with some unsavory characters. As mentioned previously with Dutere (who after election [abandoned U.S. allyship](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-14/duterte-s-tilt-toward-china-risks-upending-u-s-strategy-in-asia) in a pivot to support Beijing), Facebook has a subservient track record with nefarious leaders, including data sharing with the [Chinese government.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-privacy-congress/facebook-confirms-data-sharing-with-chinese-companies-idUSKCN1J11TY)
Apple has a similar history of capitulating to the whims the Chinese government for market access. This includes removing [60+ VPN applications](https://www.vyprvpn.com/blog/apple-appeasement-china-history-repeating) from its Mainland China app store, [censoring the Taiwanese flag emoji](https://qz.com/1723334/apple-removes-taiwan-flag-emoji-in-hong-kong-macau-in-ios-13-1-1/) for users in Hong Kong, and also removing apps aimed to [facilitate Hong Kong’s protest movement.](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/rosalindadams/apple-amazon-google-apps-blacklist-china-xinjiang) 
Google also removed a game for Hong Kong protest role play, “citing a policy around [‘sensitive events.’]”(https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/11/tech/google-hong-kong-protest/index.html) In 2018, [Google also came under scrutiny](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-google/googles-work-in-china-benefiting-chinas-military-u-s-general-idUSKCN1QV296) for engaging with projects in China as well, boasting naivete of forced technology transfer in service to China’s [Military-Civilian Fusion Policy,](https://www.state.gov/military-civil-fusion/) while simultaneously ending a contract with the U.S. government.CEO Sandir Puchar, who will be appearing before congress, declared that they would not “[develop] AI for use in weapons" in service to the U.S.’ military-industrial complex. This moral grandstanding is arbitrary. Both Facebook and YouTube are eerily effective weapons of wars that accommodate and propagate extremist ideology, further citing a direct threat to our personal and national security. Amazon also has extensive operations in China, but draws much stepper competition within 
the world’s largest market for e-commerce.

Multinational corporations have access to markets all over the world, including in places with leaders or practices that create moral dissonance. However, this is inherently damaging to technology companies, where regulation and transfer of intangible property is far more complex. Intellectual property infringement is known as [“the greatest transfer of wealth in history.”](https://foreignpolicy.com/2012/07/09/nsa-chief-cybercrime-constitutes-the-greatest-transfer-of-wealth-in-history/)
Currently, “the [Chinese Communist] party is creating high-tech monopolies inside China and [stripping foreign companies of their intellectual property](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/05/mcmaster-china-strategy/609088/) by means of theft and forced technology transfer.” Just as the antitrust legislators of the early 20th century speculated, any exchange (personal data for access to a platform, conditional censorship for market access) where “the harm was [being registered](https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox) through an economic effect—a wealth transfer—the underlying source of the grievance was also political." In dealing with authoritarian regimes, particularly China, the Big Four are facilitating a geopolitical shift to empower antidemocratic ideology. Critics of data collection, known colloquially as cypherpunks, often wondered “whether state and corporate interests would eviscerate liberty through electronic surveillance ” In the face of the Big Four, the distinction between the powers in question disintegrates. Regulating the Big Four is not simply an economic or moral imperative, it is crucial to the longevity of democracy.

## The Future of Decentralization and Democracy

I revisited the [original decree](http://www.xinhuanet.com/2019-10/25/c_1125153665.htm) of China’s blockchain initiative from October of 2019, in addition to the various interpretations of what this actually means for blockchain innovation, but also for China’s strategic position in the industry, and in the global arena. With China’s launch of the BSN, it is clear that the true nature of China’s most recent technology investment policy platform doesn’t indicate a shift in ideological priorities, but instead a command of the more practical approaches to increased efficiencies blockchain ledger technology provides. Developers within the larger blockchain community still remain wary, and it will take time to gage the long-term consequences. The initiative does allow developers to use APIs native to public chains for increased security. The BSN is in talks with several interoperability providers to increase communication and efficiency between chains. One provider in the running is [Polkadot,](https://polkadot.network/)
with security features distinct to any other in the industry. Security is built into Polkadot’s existing network of validators, which offers uniform security capabilities across all chains. This enables incontestable interchain trust that could enable broader confidence to collaborate with the BSN. I believe the effort could signal efforts to increase transparency in trade with China, especially supply chain and logistics. As always, safeguarding intellectual property is paramount; all collaborates must proceed with caution.

I disagree with many analysts that the blockchain initiative is in exclusive service to implementing a digital currency [to compete with the U.S. dollar,](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogerhuang/2020/05/25/china-will-use-its-digital-currency-to-compete-with-the-usd/#23d1a02e31e8) as many countries receive Chinese-distributed foreign aid and infrastructure investment.
This currency will use a centralized decrypted ledger technology, which troublingly accelerates the pan-optic Orwellian state. Digital currencies in this vein enable complete monitoring of all consumer transactions and eliminate cash anonymity. The implications of such expanded control might actually deter expanded investment and commerce. This paints a terrifying picture, but the motivation for an accelerated digital currency roll out was triggered by the [Libra Project.](https://libra.org/en-US/)
The aim for both was complete control; one of the state and the other corporate surveillance. What the leaders of these companies fail to realize is that the Chinese government has gleaned the knowledge for an extensive foundation of technical knowledge. The are already using this foundation to create their own monopolies, including an externally facing decentralized web infrastructure. The CCP seeks to outplay the Big Four as individual political entities on the global stage, while dually reinforcing our political and economic powerlessness at their hands in the United States. As the antitrust hearings commence, our only hope to eradicate each of these threats to our democracy is greater innovation, and it must inspire a widespread effort to implement decentralized technologies.

A hallmark of the progressive movement of the 20th century, President Teddy Roosevelt is often remembered to be a steadfast proponent of dismantling the concentration of economic power. Contemporary progressives are [less generous](https://newrepublic.com/article/148239/myth-roosevelt-trustbusters) in their interpretation of his values, citing his belief that “breaking up all big corporations, whether they have behaved well or ill,” is “an extremely insufficient and fragmentary measure.” In taking on the Big Four, it is true that simply dismantling their sprawling corporate architecture is insufficient to minimizing barriers to entry for innovation. Khan suggests that “[preventing] the industry structures that create these conflicts of interest may prove more effective than policing these conflicts." re: the creation of a decentralized, user-centric web, and therefore an opportunity to remain technologically competitive in the global ecosystem. 

These corporations see the implementation of decentralized technology is an immediate existential threat, and continued propagation of power hinges on the ruthless exploitation of the individual. Meanwhile, developing on an existing blockchain is becoming cheaper and more developer-centric that creating an independent operating system. In the case of the aforementioned [Polkadot,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IoUZdDi5Is) they have created an impressive blockchain software development kit called Substrate. With [Substrate,](https://www.parity.io/what-is-substrate/) developers use any coding language that complies with Web Assembly, offering increased flexibility. Additionally, the option of initial coin offerings (ICOs) as an instrument to supplant traditional fundraising channels further corroborates the case for accelerating the decentralized web. Developers are immediately connected to capital and customers, making corporate intermediaries obsolete.

I think about the visceral imagery used by the media to galvanize public policy support for foreign policy initiatives. With China, we see crowded polluted cities, the imprisonment of dissidents, destitute farmers ambling desperately against the backdrop of ultra modern skyscrapers. In assessing this imagery, I am immersed in the painstaking realization that this divide, from ideology to an assumption of the government’s benevolent responsibility, is shrinking. Just as we still (ostensibly) possess the power to remedy our autocrat-adjacent political reality, we must exercise political intervention to indict the Big Four’s culpability in facilitating America’s authoritarian decline as well as creating a capitalist surveillance oligopoly. American’s have always rebuked tyranny-- the image of a king suggests an assault on personal freedom.* In crafting antitrust legislation, Senator John Sherman [declared](https://www.salon.com/2019/05/09/it-is-time-to-break-up-facebook-co-founder-chris-hughes-declares/) “if we will not endure a king as a political power, we should not endure a king over the production, transportation, and sale of any of the necessities of life.” Just as autocratic imagery ignites the fire of resistance in the U.S., we must assign a tangible graphic to the self-perpetuating surveillance state. Galloway asserts “the surveillance camera and data center make visual our emerging dystopia, while privacy, anonymity, and security are so abstract as to nearly defy visual representation”

<p><align="right>The problem isn’t messaging, it’s imagining. Instead of an Instagram or Facebook post as an exercise of free speech, remember you are submitting a detailed record of your life to a pernicious conglomerate. Imagine mind control. An iPhone that makes life more convenient and fun? Alexa slays as DJ for your party? Imagine a spy. When the alternative mirage fades, we can see a future devoid of helpless interdependence on exploitative technology. Our alternative isn't just regulation, it is [the Web 3.0] revolution.
